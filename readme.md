### What is it?

Real-time visualization of streaming data from the [Meetup.com open events RSVP API](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/rsvp/).

Visualize events as a map with markers and a bar chart showing the most frequent countries, states (USA), and names.

### Built with:

- React
- Alt.js
- Leaflet
- D3.js
- Webpack

### Todo:

- include leaflet in webpack build - need to resolve issue with requesting images from css.
- switch back to non-class Alt.js setup.
- add popovers for the map markers showing the event details.
